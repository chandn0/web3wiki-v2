                <br />
                <br />
                <p>Creating a joint knowledge base, where protocol forces to produce high-quality content in collaboration. The closest one is Wikipedia, but the problem with Wikipedia is that it does not pay its editors any money, So most editors have moved to other websites like Medium.
                </p>
                <br />

                <p>some of the problems that Wikipedia faces is</p>

                <p>1. How to incentive its writer.</p>
                <p>2. How the changes are  governed.</p>
                <p>3. Censorship problems with the government </p>

                <p> But we can see that this problem has been solved in recent years in the blockchain industry.</p>

                <p>1. People in any country can be incentivized by tokens.</p>
                <p>2. Richer governance mechanisms that are already tested in web3 space.</p>
                <p>3. No censorship, because the government can not point to a group of people to shape or influence the platform in any form.</p>
